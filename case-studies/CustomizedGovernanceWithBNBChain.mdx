Back in November 2021, BNB Chain collaborated with Galxe to generate NFT Badges for the committee and MVB participants. The MVB program exists to accelerate the top dApps and builders in the BSC ecosystem. Over the past 3 seasons of MVB, BSC has welcomed over 900 projects, dozens of hackathons and events.

The committee members consists of different categories, including the BNB Chain Fund, previous MVB top players, media & influencers, top-tier investment institutions, and world-leading universities. And each committee member received an exclusive NFT Badge with which they can vote for the top projects based on their careful evaluation. The selection was based on a weighted voting model. The committee is split into 5 categories, where each category possesses a various percentage of the voting power. Each member will be required to cast their votes for 10 projects they select from the 41 MVB Monthly Stars winners.

In the future, BNB Chain will continue to utilize Galxe for the MVB program and dilute the voting power of this committee to increase decentralization and ensure a fairer and more democratic selection.
