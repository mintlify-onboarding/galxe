### The Gift from imToken[](#the-gift-from-imtoken "Direct link to heading")

## Challenge[](#challenge "Direct link to heading")

ImToken had multiple goals it wanted to reach such as expanding its overseas userbase, increasing its use of Layer 2 features and increasing its brand exposure.

## Solution[](#solution "Direct link to heading")

The strength at Galxe is our ability to join forces and collaborate with multiple partners. That’s how the ImToken Team and Galxe team created a joint campaign between ImToken and 4 major protocols: Perpetual Protocol, XY Finance, Hakka Finance and Galxe. Leveraging all four protocols to bring a better offering to our users and communities and helping each protocol unlock more growth.

imToken held four joint community activities with each protocol and users were able to claim an OAT (On-chain achievement token) after each event, with a maximum of 3 per person. The more OAT badges users held, the higher the chance they had of winning a 200 xDai / imKey Pro hardware wallet.

## Results[](#results "Direct link to heading")

A total of 3091 OATs were claimed - averaging over 770 per individual OAT. The campaign also helped each individual protocol grow their communities and have new users try out their infrastructures.

**OAT**

Galxe OATs (On-Chain Achievement Tokens) are a creative solution to distribute NFT badges to communities as a record of participation. Brands and projects can use Galxe’s infrastructure to create their own personalized OATs to reward their users. This includes anything from in-person events, various online interactions, or even AMA’s.

Galxe OATs are used for validation that a user performed an action or participated in a specific event. You can transfer or sell your OAT, but the record of the action is stored on the Galxe Credential data network. Available on Polygon and BNB chains, OATs appear in all NFT marketplaces so you can show them off.
