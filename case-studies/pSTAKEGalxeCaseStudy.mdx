### Challenge[](#challenge "Direct link to heading")

DeFi is booming, and it's only getting bigger. But for newly launched projects, it can be difficult to attract liquidity, especially for Proof of Stake (PoS) chains. Why? Staking is crucial for ensuring security in a blockchain network, but it also requires locking up cryptocurrency, thus reducing liquidity. The [BNB Chain network](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), for instance, had a low staking ratio of 11%, impacting both security and access to DeFi opportunities.

Enter [pSTAKE](https://pstake.finance/), a liquid staking protocol that allows users to enjoy the benefits of both staking and participating in DeFi. pSTAKE's liquid-staked representative for BNB, stkBNB, was launched in August, 2022\. However, to attract more users and increase liquidity, the pSTAKE team knew they needed new channels and marketing power to grow and scale. They found Galxe to be the perfect partner after extensive research, especially seeing Galxe’s presence and success on the BNB Chain.

### **Solution**[](#solution "Direct link to heading")

[Galxe](https://galxe.com?utm%5Fsource=CaseStudy&utm%5Fmedium=Docs&utm%5Fcampaign=pSTAKE) offered a suite of solutions that pSTAKE was looking for, including a plug-and-play dashboard, the unique [Galxe OAT (On-Chain Achievement Token)](https://gal.xyz/GalxeOAT) feature, and marketing services that included customizing campaigns and co-marketing efforts. The next few weeks were spent in creating a campaign structure with 2 things at the forefront:

1. Increasing total BNB deposited with pSTAKE
2. Increasing the number of users that liquid stake with pSTAKE.

The tier-based campaign structure suggested by the Galxe team allowed pSTAKE to build a highly incentivized campaign. Over the course of 7 weeks, the campaign attracted users to mint stkBNB by depositing BNB, keep staking stkBNB, and use it on one of pSTAKE's five DeFi integrations including [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/), [Alpaca Finance](https://www.alpacafinance.org/), [OpenLeverage](https://openleverage.finance/), [Beefy Finance](https://beefy.finance/), and [Wombat Exchange](https://www.wombat.exchange/). To drive more traffic and exposure to the campaign, the Galxe team also provided co-marketing support, which is a part of our premium marketing services.

The BNB Stake-to-Earn campaign was one of the highest incentivized campaigns on Galxe with rewards as high as \~52% APY. This combined with pSTAKE’s DeFi integrations resulted in an overall yield of up to \~102% APY on BNB.

### Results[](#results "Direct link to heading")

The results of the campaign were impressive, with almost \~$1.5M worth of BNB staked through pSTAKE and the user base for stkBNB doubled.

Mikhil Pandey, Lead at pSTAKE Finance, was thrilled with the outcome of the campaign, stating:

_“We were really excited about the idea of incentivizing on-chain actions with NFTs serving as a proof of those actions. Galxe’s Web3 credentials let us do exactly that to create a one of its kind BNB Stake-to-Earn campaign. The Galxe team was super supportive right from the drawing board to executing the campaign. Looking forward to the next campaign already!”_
