## Pool Party Season 1[](#pool-party-season-1 "Direct link to heading")

### Challenge[](#challenge "Direct link to heading")

PoolTogether is a protocol for prize savings. Users deposit into the protocol in order to be eligible to win thousands of daily prizes distributed randomly. Every day some users win money and some don’t, PoolTogether knew that they needed to bring in new incentivizes if they wanted to have user retention. 

### Solution[](#solution "Direct link to heading")

The initial idea was to introduce NFTs to make the protocol fun to use even without winning money prizes. PoolTogether created the Pool Party Season 1 Campaign in collaboration with Galxe. Using the Galxe Mystery box, PoolTogether launched a collectible NFT campaign of 8 cards over the course of 8 weeks. Every week, community members had to accomplish different missions ranging from depositing in the Pool, liking tweets, and testing out new features such as the delegation feature.

### Result[](#result "Direct link to heading")

A total of 21,872 NFTs were minted. But not only that, PoolTogether’s Newsletter increased from 450 subscribers to 4,439\. At end of the campaign 1,345 individual wallets tracked more than $5 million deposits and a total of 1,248 addresses voted on The PoolTogether governance. As you can see, the results speak for themselves.

**About PoolTogether**

PoolTogether is a protocol for prize savings. Users deposit into the protocol in order to be eligible to win thousands of daily prizes distributed randomly. The prizes are derived from the combined interest of all depositors. Because of this, the protocol is “no loss” meaning depositors can always withdraw all their money at any time.
