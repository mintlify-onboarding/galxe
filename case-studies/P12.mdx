## P12 Genesis Soul-Bound NFT Airdrop[](#p12-genesis-soul-bound-nft-airdrop "Direct link to heading")

## Challenge[](#challenge "Direct link to heading")

Project Twelve is a Web3 gaming platform and ecosystem with a sustainable economy. It has three modules that cover the full scope of this ecosystem. The Editor is a full-featured Metaverse content engine for building worlds. The Infra is a set of API/SDK and developer portals for bridging game content on-chain. And the Econs is a set of rules (economic and governmental) which have been implemented in EVM smart contracts. Project Twelve is the future of Web3 gaming and this is evident by the overwhelming enthusiasm which has come from the gaming community.

Project Twelve used the [Galxe](https://twitter.com/GalxeHQ) Dashboard because they wanted to bootstrap community, increase engagement, and raise brand awareness.

To obtain Project Twelve’s goal of user engagement, Galxe’s infrastructure powered a unique airdrop campaign entitled _P12 Genesis Soul-Bound NFT Airdrop_. This campaign was designed to capture off-chain gaming credentials on Steam. This included how many hours you played on Steam, or whether you published a popular game on steam. This information was recorded into Genesis Soul-Bound NFTs that rewarded to all of these players and game publishers.

Within a few weeks, they had a drastic increase in followers along with a spike in user engagement. Project Twelve now has 30K users on Twitter and on their Discord platform.
