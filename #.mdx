## What are digital credentials[](#what-are-digital-credentials "Direct link to heading")

Credentials live in our day-to-day life. An example of on-chain credentials would be the record that you borrowed money from AAVE and Compound but never got liquidated. Your contribution to a protocol’s liquidity pool when it first launched, or your on-chain voting history are all credentials. All of your behavioral data in Web2 counts towards your credentials and companies like Google and Facebook run algorithms on your credentials so that they can send you targeted advertisements.

Credentials are important due to the high use case they provide. Applications can use your credentials to calculate credit scores, find target audiences, reward community contributors, etc. With the advance of Web3 and DAOs, there will be an explosion of behavioral data generated by waves of new users. This will provide the necessary infrastructure to help these new users build digital credentials that will be of paramount importance.

## Problems with the current credential system[](#problems-with-the-current-credential-system "Direct link to heading")

Credential data today are segregated across closed databases that are owned and permissioned by applications, government organizations, and financial and credit institutions. This has led to a fractured landscape that is not open to the individuals who should own that data or the applications that need it. Galxe aims to solve this problem using an open and collaborative credential data network which will help Web3 developers leverage credential data to build better products and more engaging communities.

## Galxe Solution[](#galxe-solution "Direct link to heading")

Galxe aims to build an open and collaborative credential data network that is accessible to all developers in Web3\. We provide the infrastructure for community members to curate and contribute digital credentials to our data network. Our infrastructure supports curating credentials through multiple data sources. For on-chain credentials, curators can contribute with subgraph queries or static snapshots. For off-chain credentials, we have integrated with data sources such as [Snapshot.org](http://snapshot.org/), Twitter, and Github.

By contributing to Galxe’s Credential Data Network, curators are rewarded when credentials are used in Galxe’s Application Modules, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API. Because there are users consuming (paying to use) data in our ecosystem, this incentivizes more users to come curate for our data network.

To this day, over 2,100 partners have already launched over 10,000 campaigns on Galxe. here are some case studies to provide more info:

## Galxe ID[](#galxe-id "Direct link to heading")

With Galxe Credentials, we will be able to build a Web3 DID system that not only gives you a multi-chain identity but also lets others know more about you through your past achievements/credentials. Projects like Cyberconnect, Unipass, and Salad Venture are already utilizing Galxe Credentials within their products and we look forward to exploring this more in the future.
