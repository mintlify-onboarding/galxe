title: "Credential Data Network"
description: "Galxe aims an open and collaborative credential data network that is accessible to all developers in Web3. It provides the infrastructure for community members to curate digital credentials and contribute to the data network."
---

Galxe’s infrastructure support curating credentials through multiple data sources:

For on-chain credentials, curators can contribute with subgraph queries or static snapshots. For off-chain credentials, we integrated with data sources such as Snapshot.org, Twitter, and Github.

By contributing to Galxe's Credential Data Network, curators are rewarded when credentials are utilized in Galxe’s Application Modules, Credential Oracle Engine, and Credential API. If you want to contribute credentials to the Galxe data network during our Closed Beta, please apply [here](https://gal.xyz/application).
