Since our launch in May 2021, the community has been crucial to the growth of Galxe’s ecosystem. From curating credentials, collecting credentials, participating in campaigns, compiling tutorials, building third-party tools, helping out in Discord, the list goes on. We are grateful for our partners and the amazing campaigns they bring to life on our platform, however, we know that without our strong and dedicated community all of our success couldn’t be possible. Words can’t describe how much we appreciate and respect our community, so we wanted to thank you the best way we knew how: GAL Token Airdrop to reward our early adopters. Read more below to learn about the reward distribution details, the official airdrop date will be announced at a later time.

**So what will I get in total?**

For example:

* Alice has been on Galxe since August 2021\. By Feb 10th, Alice had the Shadowy Coder NFT, the Galxe Girl NFT, and the Meta Cowboy lv1 and lv2\. By the time of snapshot before TGE, Alice managed to mint the Meta Cowboy lv3 and kept all of the NFTs she acquired before. # of GAL token for Alice will be:  
**Shadowy Coder + (Galxe Girl Reindeer NFT x Meta Cowboy lv2 Boost) + Meta Cowboy lv1 + Meta Cowboy lv2 + Meta Cowboy lv3**  
100 + (250 \* 1.3) + 30 + 60 = 535
* Tom joined the community in mid-January. By Feb 10th, Tom has the Meta Cowboy lv1\. By the time of the snapshot before TGE, tom managed to mint Meta Cowboy lv2, lv3 & lv4, and bought Galxe Girl Reindeer NFT through Opensea. # of GAL for Tom will be:  
**(Galxe Girl Reindeer NFT x Meta Cowboy lv1 Boost) + Meta Cowboy lv1 + Meta Cowboy lv2 + Meta Cowboy lv3 + Meta Cowboy lv4**  
250 \* 1.2 + 20 + 30 + 60 + 180 = 590
* Lucy heard about Galxe from the Solana campaign. She acquired Dr. Sol, and Meta Cowboy lv1, lv2 before the snapshot. # of GAL for Lucy will be:  
**Dr. Sol + Meta Cowboy lv1 + Meta Cowboy lv2**  
30 + 20 + 30 = 80

**I bought NFTs from OpenSea, will I be eligible for the reward?**

Yes. As long as you have the NFT at the time of the snapshot, you will be eligible to receive a reward regardless of whether the NFTs were claimed directly from the campaigns, purchased, or otherwise acquired.

**Why are there restrictions for users from certain regions to claim the NFT?**

Galxe is focused on solidifying ourselves long-term in the space, we are doing our best to be legally compliant since day 1\. Because of this, users with IPs in the restricted regions will not be able to claim the airdrop tokens through the Galxe website.

**When will the snapshot for NFT holders take place?**

The snapshot has been taken on April 28th 1am PST. [Check the snapshot details here](https://github.com/GalxeHQ/galaxy-airdrop). The TGE time is set to be May 5th, 2022 at 5am PST.

**Will GAL airdrop be subject to any lockups?**

When eligible users get GAL airdrop around TGE, these tokens will be fully liquid.

**How will I receive GAL airdrop on Ethereum mainnet when I am a holder of Dr. Sol NFT on Solana?**

GAL is an ERC-20 token. You will need to bind your eligible Solana address with an Ethereum address on Galxe website in order to be able to claim the airdrop.

**If I have multiple Galxe Girl and Reindeer NFTs, will I get multiple rewards?**

No. If you hold multiple NFTs from the same category in one account, the NFT will only count once. This applies to all NFTs in the reward table.
